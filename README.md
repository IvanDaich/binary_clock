# Tick-Tock Clicks-Clocks
To learn more about the JavaScript, p5.js, I'm create as many clocks in different forms as I can imagine. Inspired by Daniel Shiffman's tutorials on The Coding Train.

Completed clocks:
* [Binary clock with 24-hour model](https://codepen.io/IvanDaich/full/XEZGNz/)
* [Binary clock with HH:MM:SS model](https://codepen.io/IvanDaich/full/pLaGXy/)
* [Hex code Clock](https://codepen.io/IvanDaich/full/qooawb/)
